// 1. We create a State
//    It has the inital value and updates like Cubit

// 2. We create Events
//    Events are names of actions from the UI to the BLoc

// 3. We create a BLoc
//    It has the events and the first state
//    In the constructor, we listen to each event using (on)
//    Inside on we write the action we want to do
